If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in

will not work!

## Roadmap

This project is completely OpenSource and maintained in my free time, so I can NOT provide any ETA when certain functionality is implemented. The future tasks i would like to be working on are labeled as *enhacement* in the Issues page of this project: 
[Enhancements](https://github.com/lejmr/dokuwiki-plugin-drawio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

I will be extremelly happy if I receive any pull request with a bug fix or a new feature. 


## How to extend this plugin?

In order to make the development as simple as possible, I prepared a Docker compose file. Using the *docker-compose* command one can simply start its development environment locally. 

This is how to start local development server:

```docker-compose up```
  
Wait until server is started, and feel free to login using *superuser:password* credentials and go on and develop.
